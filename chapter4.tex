\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}

This chapter explores the integration of artificial intelligence capabilities within our real estate platform. We have developed four distinct AI models, each addressing specific requirements within the ecosystem. These models collectively enhance user experience, improve decision-making processes, and provide valuable insights to various stakeholders in the real estate market.

The AI features presented in this chapter represent a significant competitive advantage for our platform, enabling more accurate property valuations, personalized recommendations, intelligent assistance, and efficient administrative operations. Each model has been carefully designed to solve real-world challenges faced by users interacting with real estate data and transactions.

\section{Sprint 2: Data Collection and Scraping}
\subsection*{Introduction}
This section details the data collection processes implemented to gather the real estate market data required for our AI models. 

\subsection{Real Estate Data Scraping}
\subsubsection{Data Sources}
We identified several real estate websites with
significant listings for the Tunisian market: Properstar, Remax, Home in Tunisia, and
Mubawab. These platforms offered a reasonable volume of property listings with the
attributes needed for our models. For each website, I developed a dedicated Python
script that navigated through the listings, extracted the relevant property details, and
stored the information in CSV files. This approach gave us a foundation of raw data that
could later be processed and used for training our prediction models.

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Property Valuation Use Case Description}
    \label{tab:property-valuation-use-case}
\end{table}

\subsection{Modeling}
\subsubsection{Class Diagram}

    \caption{Property Valuation Prediction Workflow Diagram}
    \label{fig:valuation-workflow}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Implementation}
\subsubsection{Data Features for Valuation}
The accuracy of the property valuation model heavily relies on the quality and comprehensiveness of the input data \cite{PatelAIRealEstate2024}. Figure \ref{fig:geo-propriety-data} outlines the key geo-property data features utilized by the model. These features capture essential characteristics of a property and its location, enabling the model to learn complex relationships and predict market values and rental incomes effectively.

    \caption{Geo-propriety Data Features for AI Models}
    \label{fig:geo-propriety-data}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Model Selection}
To develop an accurate property valuation prediction model, several regression algorithms were evaluated. The following models were selected for training and comparison due to their distinct characteristics and common effectiveness in similar predictive tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Linear Regression}: Chosen as a baseline model due to its simplicity and interpretability. It helps in understanding the linear relationships between the features and the target variables (market value and rental income).
    \item \textbf{Random Forest Regressor}: An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time. It is robust to overfitting, handles non-linear relationships well, and often provides high accuracy.
    \item \textbf{Gradient Boosting Regressor}: Another powerful ensemble technique that builds models in a stage-wise fashion. It is known for its high predictive accuracy and ability to optimize for various loss functions, making it suitable for complex regression tasks.
\end{itemize}
These models were trained on the prepared dataset, and their performances were evaluated to select the most suitable one for deployment in the Korpor platform.

\subsubsection{Feature Importance Analysis}
Understanding which features contribute most to the model's predictions is crucial for model interpretability and refinement. After training the selected model, a feature importance analysis was conducted. Figure \ref{fig:feature-importance} displays the top 15 most important features identified by the model. This analysis helps in validating the model's logic.

    \label{fig:feature-importance}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Model Evaluation and Metrics}
The performance of the trained regression models was rigorously evaluated using standard metrics to ensure reliability and accuracy. Key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²) score were computed on a held-out test dataset. Figure \ref{fig:model-test-metrics} presents a summary of these performance metrics for the chosen valuation model. These results provide a quantitative assessment of the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Real Estate Assistant Use Case Description}
    \label{tab:assistant-use-case}
\end{table}

\newpage

\subsection{Modeling}
\subsubsection{Class Diagram}
The Real Estate Assistant follows a modular architecture for NLP processing and knowledge management. Figure \ref{fig:assistant-class-diagram} shows the main classes and their relationships.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/assistant_class_diagram.png}
    \caption{Real Estate Assistant Class Diagram}
    \label{fig:assistant-class-diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Sequence Diagram (MVC)}
The interaction flow between the mobile interface, backend services, and NLP processing components is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:assistant-sequence-mvc}.
\newpage
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/assistant_sequence_mvc.png}
    \caption{Real Estate Assistant MVC Sequence Diagram}
    \label{fig:assistant-sequence-mvc}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Embedding Concept:}
Embeddings represent data (like text or images) as vectors in a space where similar items are close together. In RAG, this lets the system compare a user's query to documents and retrieve the most relevant information.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/rag_workflow_diagram.png}
    \caption{RAG Workflow Diagram}
    \label{fig:rag-workflow}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Workflow Diagram}
The Real Estate Assistant follows a structured workflow to process user queries and provide accurate legal information. Figure \ref{fig:assistant-workflow} illustrates the complete workflow from user input to response generation.
\newpage

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/assistant_workflow_diagram.png}
    \caption{Real Estate Assistant Workflow Diagram}
    \label{fig:assistant-workflow}
\end{figure}


\textbf{Advantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ideal for augmenting models with external, up-to-date, or domain-specific information
    \item Effective for constantly changing data (legal documents, regulations, FAQs)
    \item Requires limited resources and expertise compared to fine-tuning
    \item Can be implemented using established frameworks like LangChain and OpenAI API
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Decision Rationale}
For our Real Estate Assistant, we selected RAG over the other approaches for the following reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Domain Specificity:} Our model needs to respond using specialized knowledge about Tunisian real estate law and regulations that was not present in the pre-trained model's original training data
    \item \textbf{Resource Efficiency:} RAG implementation requires significantly fewer computational resources and technical expertise compared to fine-tuning
    \item \textbf{Data Characteristics:} Legal documents and regulations are constantly evolving, making RAG's ability to retrieve up-to-date information crucial
    \item \textbf{Development Speed:} RAG allows for rapid prototyping and deployment using existing frameworks and APIs
\end{enumerate}

Prompt engineering alone was insufficient for our use case, as we required the model to access and utilize domain-specific knowledge that extends beyond general conversational abilities.

\subsubsection{Prompt Engineering Implementation}
The prompt engineering approach for the Real Estate Assistant utilizes a structured template system to ensure consistent and accurate responses. The detailed implementation of the ChatPromptTemplate algorithm is provided in Appendix \ref{app:A}.

\subsection{Implementation}

\subsubsection{Large Language Model Selection}
Choosing an appropriate LLM can be challenging given the numerous companies and different models available in the market. The host organization provided us with a Google Gemini API key, which constrained our selection to the available Gemini offerings.

Among the Gemini model family, we evaluated several options:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Gemini 2.5 models}: While these represent the latest technology, they are still in experimental release phase, designed primarily to gather feedback and deliver updates quickly to developers
    \item \textbf{Gemini Flash 2.0}: Selected as the optimal choice based on efficiency and cost considerations
\end{itemize}

Gemini Flash 2.0 was chosen for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Superior efficiency and cost-effectiveness compared to other available models
    \item Lack of fine-tuning support, which reinforced our decision to implement RAG architecture
    \item Stable release status ensuring reliable performance for production deployment
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Voice Generation Implementation}
For voice generation capabilities, we selected ElevenLabs, an advanced AI-powered platform specializing in text-to-speech and voice synthesis technologies. ElevenLabs enables the generation of realistic, human-like voices suitable for various applications including narrations, audiobooks, podcasts, and video content.

The voice generation implementation utilizes ElevenLabs API to convert text responses into natural-sounding audio. The complete algorithm including error handling, audio processing, and optimization techniques is detailed in Appendix \ref{app:B}.


\subsubsection{NLP Model Architecture}
The Real Estate Assistant utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user queries. The system employs:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Intent Recognition}: Identifies the purpose of user questions (property law, taxes, contracts, etc.)
    \item \textbf{Entity Extraction}: Extracts key information like property types, locations, and legal concepts
    \item \textbf{Context Management}: Maintains conversation history for coherent multi-turn dialogues
    \item \textbf{Response Generation}: Creates natural, informative responses based on legal knowledge base
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Legal Knowledge Base}
The assistant's knowledge base contains comprehensive information about:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tunisian real estate law and regulations
    \item Property investment procedures
    \item Tax implications and calculations
    \item Contract templates and requirements
    \item Common legal issues and solutions
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Chat Interface Implementation}
The mobile chat interface provides an intuitive way for investors to interact with the AI assistant. Figure \ref{fig:assistant-mobile-chat} shows the chat interface design.
