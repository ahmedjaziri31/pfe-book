To my loving mother, whose strength and endless support shaped who I am today. To my sister and brother, whose companionship and encouragement have been constant sources of joy and motivation. To my little Aryouma, whose innocence and love bring happiness to our family every day. To Mme Nadia, my professors and mentors, who have guided me with knowledge and patience throughout my academic journey. To my friends, whose encouragement made this journey worthwhile. This work is dedicated to all of you, but especially to you, Father.}
