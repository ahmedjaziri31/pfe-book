\chapter{Analysis and Specification of Needs}

\section{Introduction}

In this chapter, we will present the analysis and specification of needs. We start by presenting the specification of the requirements, illustrating them using the diagram of the global use cases. Then we will present our project architecture and our working environment, and finally we will present our product backlog and releases planning, and we will close our chapter with a conclusion.

\section{Requirements Specification}

In this section, we will define the actors of our application and the functional and non-functional needs that our application aims to fulfill.

\subsection{Identifying Actors}

We define actors as a shorthand for the roles played by entities outside the system that interact directly with them \cite{CockburnUML2002, CockburnWritingEffectiveUseCases2000}. In our system, we identify four types of actors:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\textcolor{primary}{Super Admin}}: Responsible for the global configuration of the platform, they have extended privileges to manage administrators, oversee security, and ensure compliance. They can also configure advanced features and control all system resources.
    
    \item \textbf{\textcolor{primary}{Admin}}: In charge of the day-to-day management of the platform, they can add, modify, or delete listings, supervise agency and user profiles, and ensure smooth operations. They are also responsible for monitoring and assisting other actors.
    
    \item \textbf{\textcolor{primary}{Real Estate Agent}}: Dedicated to creating and updating real estate listings, they manage property information, handle investor requests, and finalize transactions related to sales or rentals. They can also coordinate property visits and propose tailored offers.
    
    \item \textbf{\textcolor{primary}{Investor}}: A user who wishes to browse and finance real estate projects. They have access to all available offers, can make investments in a few simple steps, and monitor the evolution of their portfolio. They also benefit from personalized insights to optimize their investments.
    
    \item \textbf{\textcolor{primary}{System}}: The entity that automatically manages all basic functionalities, such as authentication, notification generation, transaction validation, and adherence to security protocols. It ensures the coherence and reliability of the application at all times.
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Non-functional Requirements}

In order to ensure the proper functioning of the decision-making system and to avoid any kind of anomaly, the implemented solution must meet a set of non-functional needs such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Maintainability}: The system must be designed for simplicity so that tasks, updates, and bug fixes can be executed with minimal complexity \cite{DevOpsFoundation2023, FowlerRefactoring2018}.
    
    \item \textbf{Evolution}: Platform administration must remain attentive to user needs and feedback, continuously enhancing the services offered while preserving the application's utility and efficiency \cite{PoppendieckLean2012, KnibergLeanStartup2013}.
    
    \item \textbf{Security}: Robust security measures are essential. The platform must enforce strong authentication protocols, access privileges, and comprehensive data encryption (both at rest and in transit) \cite{ClerkAuthenticationDocs, OWASPSecurityPrinciples2021}. The integration of blockchain technology further ensures the immutability and integrity of sensitive information \cite{WangBlockchainRealEstate2023, McKinseyBlockchainRE2023}.
    
    \item \textbf{Efficiency}: The application must be effective in all circumstances, delivering prompt and reliable functionality regardless of external conditions \cite{KimDevOpsMethods2018, BassArchitecture2021}.
    
    \item \textbf{Performance}: The system must operate optimally across diverse environments. It should consistently provide a responsive and reliable experience, even under high transaction volumes or varying network conditions \cite{DockerArchitecture2023, ForsgreniDevOpsMetrics2023}.
\end{itemize} 

\section{Requirements Analysis}

In this section, we'll outline the various features that our app should offer, using a general use case diagram \cite{CockburnUML2002}.

\subsection{General use case diagram}

Below, we present the various actors of the application and the actions they are authorized to perform.
The overall diagram is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:use-case-diagram}:

\end{figure}

\section{Software architecture}

Before starting the design and development of any computerized system, it is essential to prepare the architecture.

\subsection{Physical architecture}

 The physical architecture of Korpor leverages modern, scalable technologies to deliver a seamless investment platform. The frontend is built with Expo, React, and TypeScript using Vite \cite{ViteJSWebsite} for rapid development and Tanstack for robust state management and data visualization, while Storybook supports isolated UI component development \cite{StorybookDocs2022}. The backend relies on Express.js \cite{ExpressJSWebsite} with user authentication managed by Clerk \cite{ClerkAuthenticationDocs}, containerization via Docker \cite{DockerArchitecture2023}, and MySQL \cite{MySQLWebsite} for data storage hosted on Microsoft Azure \cite{AzureCloudServices2024}. Integrated AI modules provide personalized insights \cite{JohnsonAIPropertyValuation2024}, and blockchain technology ensures transactional security and data immutability \cite{WangBlockchainRealEstate2023, McKinseyBlockchainRE2023}. This setup is further supported by GitHub \cite{GithubWebsite} for version control, Postman \cite{PostmanWebsite} for API testing, and end-to-end testing tools like Maestro and Playwright \cite{PlaywrightDocs2023}, with architectural designs and documentation maintained using StarUML \cite{StarUMLWebsite} and Overleaf.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    % Replace with actual image file once available
    % \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{images/physical_architecture.png}
    \caption{Deployment diagram}
    \label{fig:physical-architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Logical architecture}

To better manage code organization and ensure maintainability, we've designed our application based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) \cite{SunardiMVC2019, GammaPatterns1994} architectural pattern:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model}: Represents application data and business logic.
    \item \textbf{View}: Presents data to users through interfaces.
    \item \textbf{Controller}: Processes incoming requests, performs operations using Models, and returns appropriate Views.
\end{itemize}

Architecture Components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model:} The MySQL database serves as the core data source, responsible for storing and managing application data, including user profiles, real estate listings, transactions, and investment records. The data layer interacts with the backend through ORM or query-based operations, ensuring efficient data retrieval and persistence.
    
    \item \textbf{Controller:} The Express.js backend acts as the intermediary between the database and the frontend, handling user requests, business logic, and data validation. It processes API calls from the frontend and interacts with services such as Clerk for authentication, AI modules for predictive analytics, and blockchain integration for secure transactions.
    
    \item \textbf{View:} The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and TanStack tools, ensuring a responsive and interactive UI. The frontend communicates with the backend via API requests, displaying dynamic content and allowing seamless user interaction.
\end{itemize}

The logical architecture is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:logical-architecture}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    % Replace with actual image file once available
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/logique.png}
    \caption{Logical architecture}
    \label{fig:logical-architecture}
\end{figure}

Request Flow:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A user action (e.g., viewing property listings) triggers a request in the frontend.
    \item The request is sent to the backend via an API call.
    \item The Express.js controller processes the request, interacting with the database and other services.
    \item Data is retrieved, processed, and returned as a response.
    \item The frontend updates the UI dynamically based on the received data.
\end{enumerate}

This structured approach ensures a scalable, secure, and high-performance system, optimizing Korpor's real estate investment and management operations \cite{KimDevOpsMethods2018}.

\section{Work Environment}

In this part, we will talk about our work environment, focusing on different aspects:

\subsection{Source code management with Git and GitHub}

We used GitHub \cite{GithubWebsite} for storing our application code. We set up a repository with a structured branching strategy to ensure organized development.
\newpage

The main branch maintains the history of official releases, while the develop branch is used for integrating new features. This approach allows us to maintain a stable production version while simultaneously developing new functionality.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/gitWorkflow.png}
    \caption{Git Workflow}
    \label{fig:git-workflow}
\end{figure}

For each new feature or bug fix, we create a feature branch from develop. Once the work is completed and tested, it is merged back into develop through a pull request process. This ensures code review and quality control before any changes are integrated. When a release is ready, develop is merged into main, creating a new stable version of the application.

\section{Product backlog}

The backlog was created before the sprints to plan the milestones and determine the content of each sprint based on project needs \cite{ProductBacklogGuide2024, SchwarzScrum2019}. It includes the following fields:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Code:} The unique identifier of the task.
    \item \textbf{Theme:} The subject of a user story.
    \item \textbf{User Story:} A short description of the functionality requested by the client.
    \item \textbf{Priority:} A value indicating the importance of the functionality \cite{MoscowMethodology2021, CleggCaseMethod2004}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Must:} The feature is essential and must be implemented.
        \item \textbf{Should:} The feature should be implemented if possible.
        \item \textbf{Could:} The feature is optional and may be deprioritized.
        \item \textbf{Won't:} The feature is not a priority at this time.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Sprint planning}

In order to complete the project within the deadlines set by the internship agreement, planning is an important step in the process \cite{SutherlandScrum2020, RubinEssentialScrum2012}. It was therefore necessary to define the essential steps and estimate the time to be devoted to the completion of the various tasks. To do this, we made a GANTT chart.

In our project management, we opted for the proportional distribution method in order to estimate the costs \cite{CohnAgileEstimating2005, GreningPlanningPoker2002}.
Figure \ref{fig:gantt-chart} shows the Gantt chart that describes the progress of our project:

\section{Conclusion}

Our Sprint 0 marked the exciting start of our KORPOR project \cite{ScaledAgileFramework2024, SutherlandScrum2020}. We defined global and specific objectives, developed a solid architecture, and configured an optimal working environment. With a clear vision of the initial product backlog and preliminary planning for upcoming sprints, we are ready to achieve our vision and achieve our goals successfully \cite{SchwarzScrum2019, RubinEssentialScrum2012}.
