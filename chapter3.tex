\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}
This chapter presents the authentication and user management system, which forms the security foundation of the Korpor platform. The implementation covers user registration, role-based access control, and comprehensive authentication workflows for both web and mobile interfaces.

 
\section{Sprint 1: Authentication and User Management}

\subsection*{Introduction}
The first sprint focuses on establishing the core authentication system and user management functionality. This foundation is critical for all subsequent features as it defines user roles and access controls.

\subsection{Analysis}
The Authentication and User Management system underpins Korpor's security and user access. It covers registration with roles, secure login, password recovery, and session management. Figure~\ref{fig:auth-usermgmt-usecase} shows the main use cases.

        \hline
        \textbf{Step} & \textbf{Description} \\
        \hline
        Start Sign-Up & User navigates to the sign-up page and presses the sign-up button. \\
        \hline
        Fill Form & System presents a form for the user to complete. \\
        \hline
        Validate Information & Upon submission, the system validates the entered information. \\
        \hline
        Invalid Information & If invalid, user is prompted to correct the form. \\
        \hline
        Valid Information & If valid, system saves user details and sends a verification email. \\
        \hline
        Email Verification & User checks their email and verifies their account. \\
        \hline
        Verification Success & System redirects user to an email verification code page or confirmation step. \\

\subsection{Modeling}

Figure \ref{fig:auth-class-diagram} depicts the class diagram for the authentication system. It showcases the key components and their relationships involved in user authentication and authorization.
\newpage
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/auth_classdiag.PNG}
    \caption{Authentication AND User Management System Class Diagram}
    \label{fig:auth-class-diagram}
\end{figure}


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AuthComponents}: Represents the UI elements for authentication, such as SignInForm, SignUpForm, ForgotPasswordForm, ResetPasswordForm, and OTPVerification. These components are used by \textbf{MobileAuthScreens}.
    \item \textbf{MobileAuthScreens}: Includes screens like LoginScreen, SignupScreen, and ForgotPasswordScreen that utilize \textbf{AuthComponents} and interact with the \textbf{AuthService}.
    \item \textbf{AuthService}: Acts as an intermediary between the frontend components/screens and the backend. It handles functions like signIn, signUp, verifyEmail, forgotPassword, resetPassword, logout, refreshToken, and error handling. It consumes \textbf{AuthRoutes}.
    \item \textbf{AuthRoutes}: Defines the API endpoints for authentication, such as /login, /register, /verify-email, /forgot-password, /reset-password, /logout, and /refresh-token. These routes map to methods in the \textbf{AuthController}.
    \item \textbf{AuthController}: Contains the core logic for authentication processes, including login, register, verifyEmail, resetPassword, changePassword, logout, refreshToken, and sendVerificationEmail. It interacts with the \textbf{User}, \textbf{Role}, and \textbf{BlacklistedToken} models and utilizes \textbf{AuthMiddleware}.
    \item \textbf{AuthMiddleware}: Provides middleware functions for authentication (authenticate) and authorization (authorize roles). It also manages blacklisted tokens (blacklistToken) and interacts with the \textbf{User} model.
    \item \textbf{User}: Represents the user entity with attributes like id, accountNo, name, surname, email, password, birthdate, resetCode, isVerified, approvalStatus, failedLoginAttempts, lockedUntil, refreshToken, and refreshTokenExpires. A User has one or more \textbf{Role}s.
    \item \textbf{Role}: Defines user roles with attributes like id, name, privileges (JSON), and description. Each User is associated with a Role (0..1 relationship shown, typically a User has at least one Role, but the diagram indicates a User can have zero or one Role, which might need clarification or represent a specific system design choice, e.g., a default role or a user awaiting role assignment).
    \item \textbf{BlacklistedToken}: Stores tokens that have been invalidated (e.g., after logout or password change) with attributes like id, token, and expiresAt. It includes methods like isBlacklisted and cleanupExpired. The \textbf{AuthController} uses this to validate tokens, and \textbf{AuthMiddleware} checks against it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation}
The implementation of the authentication and user management system resulted in the following key user interfaces:

\subsubsection{Sign-in Interface}
The sign-in interface provides a secure and user-friendly means for users to authenticate. Figure \ref{fig:signin-interface} shows the implementation of this interface.

    \caption{Sign-in Interface Implementation}
    \label{fig:signin-interface}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Sign-up Interface}
The sign-up interface allows new users to register for an account. It collects necessary information and begins the verification process. Figure \ref{fig:signup-interface} displays this implementation.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \caption{Sign-up Interface Implementation}
    \label{fig:signup-interface}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{User Management in Super Admin Dashboard}
The Super Admin dashboard provides comprehensive user management capabilities, including the ability to view, create, edit, and deactivate user accounts. Figure \ref{fig:user-management} shows this powerful interface.

\end{figure}

The mobile application provides a streamlined authentication experience for investors. The system includes comprehensive error handling to guide users through common authentication issues, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mobile-auth-errors}. The complete authentication flow includes login, signup, OTP verification, and password recovery interfaces designed for clarity and ease of use on mobile devices, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mobile-auth-interfaces}.

\subsection{Test}
To ensure the reliability and functionality of the authentication and user management system, we implemented comprehensive testing using Playwright, an end-to-end testing framework.

\subsubsection{Playwright Test Results}
The authentication system underwent rigorous testing through automated test scripts that verified all key functionality, including sign-up, sign-in, password reset, and user management operations. Figure \ref{fig:playwright-tests} demonstrates the successful execution of these tests.

All tests passed successfully, confirming the robustness of the implemented authentication system.
