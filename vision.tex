\firstparagraph{T}he culmination of this project is not merely the delivery of a functional platform, but the foundation for \textbf{my future tech company, Korpor}. The sponsoring company has graciously agreed to provide the core application codebase, enabling the launch of this independent startup. Korpor will be dedicated to the continuous development and enhancement of this real estate investment platform.

This section will elaborate on the operational model for Korpor, focusing on its evolution into a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider for the wider real estate industry, its market strategy, and its potential impact.
